Now that coordinates sometimes are complicated real numbers and are not convenient for lookup, it is desirable to attach to each point with a sensible id. Then you may agree that the most appropriate data structure representing a point should contain two parts, the id part and the coordinate part. But the story does not end up here. This is because we want to compress the whole spatial info of a lattice into its unitcells. For each lattice, there exists a freedom to choose its unitcells. Sometimes we even need enlarged unitcells. Therefore, something must be adopted to keep the info of which unitcell a point belongs to in the lattice. This information is useful even when we only keep the data of points within a single unitcell because at this time we usually have to obtain those bonds across the unitcell boundaries that must contain a point in other unitcells.

Although the names of a named vector cannot be changed, the values can be modified if needed. In contrast to the predefined NamedTuple in Julia, which employs the names as type parameters, we just implement a named vector as a composite struct equipped with the getindex and setindex! functions, with the fieldnames being its names. This simple implementation makes it possible to define your own concrete named vector with any of your preferred type names, and ensures that all instances of a certain concrete named vector share the same names. Therefore, if you are familiar with Python, you will find that our named vector is more qualified to be the counterpart of the namedtuple in Python than the default Julia implementation. Last but not least important, it is also worth noted that a named vector is not a vector, as is similar to that a named tuple is not a tuple in Julia.

sum of individual ones. Therefore, in principle, an algebra can be represented by the complete basis set of its corresponding vector space and a rank-3 tensor encapsulating its structure constants. It is noted that the \"bilinear operation\" is not restriced to the usual multiplication only. For example, it is the commutator, which is a composition of the usual multiplication and subtraction (for any A and B, the commutator [A,B] is defined as [A,B]≝AB-BA) that serves as the bilinear operator for Lie algebras. In this module, for scalars in the field and elements in the algebra, we only provide the interfaces of the scalar multiplication (including the scalar division) bwteen a sclar and an element, the addition (including the subtraction) and the usual multiplication between two elements. Other complicated operations should be composed from these basic ones.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/Mathematics/AlgebraOverFields/#SimpleID-and-ID-1","page":"Algebra over fields","title":"SimpleID and ID","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"man/Mathematics/AlgebraOverFields/#","page":"Algebra over fields","title":"Algebra over fields","text":"SimpleID is the building block of the id system of an algebra over a field, while ID defines the specific identifier of an element in that algebra.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/Mathematics/AlgebraOverFields/#","page":"Algebra over fields","title":"Algebra over fields","text":"Generally, the usual multiplication between two elements of an algebra is not commutable, and the rank of the multiplication is just the add-up before the simplication with the help of the algebra structure. We thus use a simple id to denote a single basis of the corresponding vector space, and an id to denote the identifier of an element. With the help of the direct product (⊗) of two ids, an over complete id system designed for the whole algebra is constructed. This id system is redundant because it does not reflects the structure constants of the algebra, which reduces independent basis elements. Extra mechanisms should be provided to kill this redundancy, which goes beyond the current module.

In practice, quantum numbers can be integers or half integers, therefore, we use real numbers to denote them in this module for simplicity. Independent quantum numbers, such as the particle number and the spin z-component, can coexist at the same time. We use type AbelianNumber to represent the complete set of independent ones for a single basis of a Hilbert space, and type AbelianNumbers to represent the whole quantum numbers for the total bases.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/Mathematics/QuantumNumbers/#AbelianNumber-1","page":"Quantum numbers","title":"AbelianNumber","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"man/Mathematics/QuantumNumbers/#","page":"Quantum numbers","title":"Quantum numbers","text":"The abstract type for the complete set of independent quantum numbers for a single basis.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/Mathematics/QuantumNumbers/#","page":"Quantum numbers","title":"Quantum numbers","text":"Main features include:","category":"page"},{"location":"man/Mathematics/QuantumNumbers/#","page":"Quantum numbers","title":"Quantum numbers","text":"function fieldnames: get the names of the quantum numbers\nfunction periods: get the periods of the quantum numbers\narithmetic operations: +, -, *, ^, ⊕, ⊗\nhashable: concrete instances can be used as keys for a dict or a set\niterable: concrete instances are iterable over their values\ncomparable: two concrete instances can be compared","category":"page"},{"location":"man/Mathematics/QuantumNumbers/#","page":"Quantum numbers","title":"Quantum numbers","text":"In particular, AbelianNumber <: HomoNamedVector{Float}, all features supported by HomoNamedVector are also available for HomoNamedVector.

Indeed, our quantum numbers are always discrete Abelian ones and all instances of a concrete AbelianNumber forms a module over the ring of integers. Therefore, each quantum number can be represented as a integral multiple of the unit element of the Abelian module, which results in the final reduction of the above equation to a set of linear Diophantine equations. Then finding a decomposition is equivalent to find a solution of the reduced linear Diophantine equations, with the restriction that the quantum numbers constructed from the solution should be in the corresponding qnses.

Otherwise the lattice will be open in all directions. To search for the bonds accorss the periodic boundaries, the cluster will be pretranslated to become a supercluster, which has open boundaries but is large enough to contain all the nearest neighbors within the required order. The coordination parameter sets the average number of each order of nearest neighbors. If it is to small, larger bond lengths may not be searched, and the result will contain Inf. This is a sign that you may need a larger coordination. Another situation that Inf appears in the result occurs when the minimum lengths are searched in open lattices.
