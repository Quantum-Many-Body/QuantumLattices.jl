# Introduction

This module contains the prerequisites of the package.

The constants, types, macros, functions or submodules defined in this module will **not** be exported by the package. Instead, they serve as the prerequisites. The range of the contents are quite wide, but basically, they fall into two categories:
* Global constants and miscellaneous tiny useful functions;
* Basic data structures as supplements to the `Julia.Base` and other common packages.
The first category is contained in the main body of this module, while the other comes in separate submodules.

## Constants and functions

All the following constants and functions in this section are defined in the main body and are exported by this module.

```@docs
atol
rtol
Float
decimaltostr
ordinal
delta
```

## Basic structures

Here lists the table of contents of the basic data structures that are supplements to the `Julia.Base` and other common packages:
```@contents
Pages = [
        "Combinatorics.md",
        "Traits.md",
        "CompositeStructures.md",
        "SimpleTrees.md",
        "NamedVectors.md",
        "VectorSpaces.md",
        "QuantumNumbers.md",
        ]
Depth = 2
